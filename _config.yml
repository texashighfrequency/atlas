# All Jekyll-Bootstrap specific configurations are namespaced into this hash
#
JB:
  version: 0.3.0
  # All links will be namespaced by BASE_PATH if defined.
  # Links in your website should always be prefixed with {{BASE_PATH}}
  # however this value will be dynamically changed depending on your deployment situation.
  #
  # CNAME (http://yourcustomdomain.com)
  #   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH
  #   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)

  # GitHub Pages (http://username.github.io)
  #   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH
  #   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)
  #
  # GitHub Project Pages (http://username.github.io/project-name)

  #   A GitHub Project site exists in the `gh-pages` branch of one of your repositories.

  # CAUTION:
  #   - When in Localhost, your site will run from root "/" regardless of BASE_PATH
  #   - Only the following values are falsy: ["", null, false]
  #   - When setting BASE_PATH it must be a valid url.
  #     This means always setting the protocol (http|https) or prefixing with "/"
